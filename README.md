Simple choices and their response times have been stalwart measures in psychological research. They have been used to gain insight into memory, vision, clinical disorders, social biases, and even consciousness.

However, when studying cognition and the brain, even a very simple choice, such as pressing a button to indicate whether an arrow is pointing to the left or right, is hard to decode. A complex stream of neural activity leads to the final simple act of hitting a key to indicate the final choice. Furthermore, choices and responses times can be impacted in subtle ways by the stimuli a person sees, the context he or she is in, and even by recent responses from previous choices.

As a [quantitative psychologist](http://www.apa.org/research/tools/quantitative/), my research interest focus on building and applying mathematical models that can describe these simple choices and response times. I am also interested in making these models easier for psychologists in other fields to apply to their own work.
