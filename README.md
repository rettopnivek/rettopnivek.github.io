I am a [quantitative psychologist](http://www.apa.org/research/tools/quantitative/). I develop and apply computational and mathematical models for a variety of cognitive tasks (with a focus on models of decision making and response times). I currently work as a statistician in the Center for Addiction Medicine at the Mass General Brigham Hospital.
