I've collected snippets of R code here that I often end up using. The hope is to save time by including the code here so that I don't have to perpetually search the internet anew.  

o How to create a [progress bar](http://rettopnivek.github.io/pages/Progress_bar.html) in R.  
o How to [print to the console window](http://rettopnivek.github.io/pages/Rcpp_console_print.html) in Rcpp.  
o How to [set column names](http://rettopnivek.github.io/pages/Rcpp_column_names.html) for a matrix in Rcpp.
